# Facebump
This is a pet project to build a Real World contact exchanger. Uses the phone's camera to exchange contact information via a QR code generated upon the screen.  To build you will need to have Xcode installed as well as the gem cocoapods. Run '$ pod install ' in the terminal then use '$ open Facebump.xcworkspace' to open the application. Warning it will only really work on a physical device as the simulator doesn't have a camera to properly access.
